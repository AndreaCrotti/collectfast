Collectfast
===========

[![Downloads](https://pypip.in/v/Collectfast/badge.png)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Collectfast)

The fast `collectstatic` for Django projects with S3 as storage backend.

Running Django's `collectstatic` command can become really slow as more and more files are 
added to a project, especially if heavy libraries such as jQuery UI are included in the source.
This is a custom management command that compares the md5 sum of files with S3 and completely
ignores `modified_time`. The results of the hash lookups are cached locally using your default
Django cache. This can make deploying much faster!

Installation
------------

Install the app using pip:

    $ pip install Collectfast

Make sure you have this in your settings file and add `'collectfast'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
STATICFILES_STORAGE = "storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage"
AWS_PRELOAD_METADATA = True
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # â€¦
    'collectfast',
)
```

Usage
-----

Collectfast overrides Django's builtin `collectstatic` command so just run
`python manage.py collectstatic` as normal. You can disable collectfast
by using the `--ignore-etag` option.
